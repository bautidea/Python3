python 3 proyects

  All these projects were carried out during python3 dimplomature, in all levels i worked with the graphic interface, Tkinter.

  At initial level i made an app in which the user annotate the amount of materials needed in a construction, then, it can obtain the sum of all materials and make a budget. All information is stored in a SQL database, which the user can access, query and modify.
  
  At this level, basic syntax is used such as functions, conditionals, loops, regular expression (regex), SQL database, exceptions

  At intermediate level, the application has the same functionalities, with some upgrades.
  
  Object oriented programming was applied, using classes, inheritance, creating different modules ('main', 'modelo' and 'objeto'), creating log files and improving the use of exceptions.

  At advanced level, applied some tweeks to the previous app and carried out a side proyect ad agenda.
  
  In the app wich calculates the materials needed in a construction i changed from SQL to SQLite3 database.
  
  In both apps (agenda and construcction) i implemented an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), using peewee, which is used to handle the CRUD of the database.
  
  Applied  method delegation and operator overloading techniques. Through the application of Namespaces, decorators, descriptors and metaclasses, to intercept attributes from class or instance methods.
  
  Also used observer pattern, to create a log file (like previous apps), instead of using a method to do so.
