python 3 proyects

All these projects were realized during python3 dimplomature, in all levels i worked with the graphic interface, Tkinter.

At initial level i made an app in which the user annotate the amount of materials needed in a construction, then, it can obtain the sum of all materials and make a budget (all information is stored in a SQL database, which the user can access, query and modify all the data)
At this level, basic syntax is used such as functions, conditionals, loops, regular expression (regex), SQL database, exceptions

At intermediate level, the application has the same functionalities, with some upgrades.
Object oriented programming was applied, using classes, inheritance, creating different modules ('main', 'modelo' and 'objeto'), creating log files and improving the use of exceptions.

At the advanced level, applied some tweeks to the previous app. Also a new application was created, an agenda.
Here we switch from the SQL database to the SQLite3 database (in both apps), implementing an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), using peewee, which we use to handle the CRUD of the database.
Applied the technique of, method delegation and operator overloading. Through the application of Namespaces, decorators, descriptors and metaclasses, to intercept attributes from class or instance methods.
Also used observer pattern, to create a log file (like previous apps), instead of using a method to do so.
