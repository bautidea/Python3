python 3 proyects

  All these projects were carried out during python3 dimplomature, in all levels i worked with the graphic interface, Tkinter.

  At initial level, made a tkinter app to compute materials needed for the structure of a building. In which the user annotates the amount of materials needed in a construction project obtains the sum of all materials and makes a budget. All information is stored in a SQL database, which the user can access, query, and modify.
  Basic syntaxis is used such as functions, conditionals, loops, regular expression (regex), SQL database and the use of exceptions.

  At intermediate level, the application has the same functionalities, with some upgrades.
  
  Object-oriented programming was applied, using classes, inheritance, creating different modules ('main', 'modelo' and 'objeto'), creating log files and improving the use of exceptions.

  At advanced level, applied some tweaks to the previous app and carried out a side project, an agenda.

  Changed from MySQL to SQLite3 database.

  In both apps Object Relational Mapping (ORM) was implemented, using peewee, which is used to handle the CRUD of the database.

  Applied method delegation and operator overloading techniques. Through the application of Namespaces, decorators, descriptors and metaclasses, to intercept attributes from class or instance methods.
  Also used an observer pattern, to create a log file (like previous apps), instead of using a method to do so.
